# MOVIE RECOMMENDER
This movie recommender recommends a list of movies based on a certain movie selected from the list of movies avaible. It considers the movie details like title, overview, genres, keywords etc of the movie chosen and returns a list of 20 movies that are much more similar, related or in the same category as the movie based on to recommend. The movies are returned in order of decreasing similarity from the most similar to less similar movie.
It is important to note that at the moment, the application can only give recommendation for a list of movies that are available in the search list.

You can check out the deployed application here-> [MOVIE_RECOMMENDER](#)

# RELATED PROJECTS
Here are some projects that are related or might be of interest:
1. [Movie-Recommendation-Flask-App](https://github.com/yukti99/Movie-Recommendation-Flask-App): This machine learning project is a Flask Web Application that uses collaborative item-to-item filtering to recommend suitable movies based on userâ€™s rating of a previously watched movie.
2. [Recommender](https://github.com/AineshSootha/Recommender): The program allows the user to enter the title of the movie they have watched and choose what they liked about the movie. They may choose Genre , Cast or Collection. Each of these options prompts the program to call a different function. If the user chooses Genre, the program would return a list of movies with similar genres sorted according to the similarity of their summaries.
